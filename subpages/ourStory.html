        We first grew the Fuyu Persimmons at Tom's family farm in the San
        Joaquin Valley in Central California. The first planting was six acres
        in Exeter, California in 2010. Once we got a taste for this delicious
        fruit, we found farmers in Georgia who had been successfully growing
        the fruit and had a one-acre test field. We then planted ten acres at
        our farm in Glennville, Georgia in 2015. We have been growing and
        selling the fruit for 12 years now. We now have twenty planted acres
        in Glennville, Georgia.<br /><br />
        Almost from the beginning, Laura has been making products from the
        persimmons. Laura loves to cook and creatively explore all the ways to
        use the fruit. She established a licensed kitchen in order to sell her
        products in 2017. She established the licensed business "Georgia Farm
        Products" in 2019 to sell wholesale & on the Internet. In the
        beginning, products would sell out during the season and be gone for
        the rest of the year. However, as the trees grew and the crops got
        bigger, more of the persimmons could be held back to make more
        products. There is finally enough inventory to celebrate the Sweet
        Georgia Fuyu Persimmon all year long!
